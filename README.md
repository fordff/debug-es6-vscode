Node : v 12.10.0
Babel.js : v 7.7.4

Babel is a JavaScript compiler
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

- Transform syntax
- Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through @babel/polyfill)
- Source code transformations (codemods)
- And more! (check out these videos for inspiration)
